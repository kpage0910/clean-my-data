# Project Framework You Can Use Forever

This is the exact system indie devs and solo builders use to finish projects.

Use this for ANY project (your cloud storage, email cleaner, data tool, etc.).

---

## Step 1 — Start with the Problem (One Sentence)

Keep it stupid simple. Write one sentence that describes the user need.

**Examples:**

* “I want a place to write and publish articles.”
* “I want to clean messy CSVs instantly.”
* “I want to organize files automatically.”

---

## Step 2 — Define the Core Loop

Ask:

**What is the ONE thing the user must be able to do?**

Examples of core loops:

* **Blog** → create post → view post
* **Cloud storage** → upload file → view file
* **Email cleaner** → connect inbox → clean emails
* **Data cleaner** → upload CSV → return cleaned CSV
* **RateMyProgram** → find program → see rating

This is the laser focus. Nothing else matters until this works.

## Step 3 — Build the Minimum Working Version (MWV)

The MWV is always:

* ✔️ **Input**
* ✔️ **Processing**
* ✔️ **Output**

Build that FIRST. Deploy it. Ship.

---

## Step 4 — Layer Features Gradually

Do NOT build everything at once. Follow this order:

1. **core loop**
2. **storage**
3. **UI**
4. **deploy**
5. **auth** (only if needed)
6. **extras**
7. **polish**

This ordering is how devs actually finish projects.

---

## Step 5 — Fix Pain Points As They Come Up

This is where “Primeagen mode” comes in. When something breaks, go deep **only** on that specific problem. Diagnose the cause, learn the minimal mental model you need, then fix it.

---

## Step 6 — Iterate Until It Feels Complete

Now you can:

* polish
* refactor
* optimize
* improve UI
* fix bugs
* add final features

Most people start here and never finish. You will not.

## Quick Reminder

Start small. Ship fast. Learn on demand. Reuse patterns.
